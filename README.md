This is a medical repository intended to be used by a school nurse. 
It's functions are specifically modified to do so
Credit for initial code goes to Mr. Martin Mbithi


To run:
Please download XAMPP. Start Apache and MySQL.
Add hmisphp.sql file (in folder named "database file") as a database in phttps://localhost/hpmyadmin
Type https://localhost/"X".  Where X = the folder where this repository is downloaded in.
That's all!

Some features are still in development. Unforunately, errors were ran into in the final stages of coding. Please excuse this.
